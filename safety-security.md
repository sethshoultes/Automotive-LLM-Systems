# Safety & Security Protocols

## Safety-First Design Philosophy

### Core Safety Principles
**Fail-Safe Design**
- System defaults to safe state on failure
- No single point of failure for safety-critical functions
- Graceful degradation of non-essential features
- Emergency manual override always available

**Defense in Depth**
- Multiple layers of safety validation
- Independent monitoring systems
- Redundant safety checks
- Hardware-level safety switches

**Human Override Authority**
- Driver maintains ultimate control
- Manual controls always functional
- System cannot override driver input
- Clear indication of system status

## Functional Safety Architecture

### Safety Integrity Levels (SIL)
**SIL 0 (No Safety Function)**
- Infotainment features
- Convenience functions
- Non-critical monitoring

**SIL 1 (Low Risk)**
- Interior lighting control
- Climate comfort settings
- Audio system control

**SIL 2 (Moderate Risk)**
- Engine parameter monitoring
- Fuel system optimization
- Performance tuning limits

**SIL 3 (High Risk)**
- Critical system monitoring
- Emergency alerts
- Safety system integration

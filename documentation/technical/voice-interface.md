    "channels": 4,  # Multi-mic array
    "bit_depth": 16,
    "chunk_size": 1024,
    "buffer_duration": 3.0,  # seconds
    "vad_threshold": 0.3
}
```

## Natural Language Understanding

### Intent Recognition
**Core Intents**
- `climate_control`: HVAC system management
- `lighting_control`: Interior/exterior lighting
- `engine_management`: Performance and diagnostics
- `audio_control`: Media and volume
- `vehicle_status`: Information requests
- `emergency_action`: Safety and emergency
- `system_config`: Settings and preferences

**Intent Classification Examples**
```
"Turn up the heat" → climate_control + increase + temperature
"Dim the dashboard lights" → lighting_control + decrease + dashboard
"What's my engine temperature?" → vehicle_status + query + engine_temp
"Play some music" → audio_control + activate + media
"Emergency stop all systems" → emergency_action + stop + all
```

### Entity Extraction
**Numeric Entities**
- Temperature values (°F/°C)
- Percentage values (0-100%)
- Speed values (MPH/KPH)
- Pressure values (PSI/bar)

**Temporal Entities**
- "in 5 minutes"
- "after we stop"
- "when engine is warm"
- "before we arrive"

**System Entities**
- Component names (engine, transmission, HVAC)
- Zones (front, rear, driver, passenger)
- Modes (auto, manual, sport, eco)
- States (on, off, high, low, medium)

## Command Processing Architecture

### Multi-Turn Conversations
**Context Management**
```
User: "Turn on the AC"
System: "AC is now on. Current temperature is 75°F."
User: "Make it cooler"
System: "Setting temperature to 70°F."
User: "That's perfect"
System: "Temperature locked at 70°F."
```

**Context Window**
- Maintains 5-turn conversation history
- Vehicle state context preservation
- User preference memory
- Session-based learning

### Confirmation Protocols
**Safety-Critical Commands**
```
User: "Increase engine boost pressure"
System: "This will increase boost to 12 PSI. Confirm with 'Yes, do it' to proceed."
User: "Yes, do it"
System: "Boost pressure increased to 12 PSI. Monitoring for safety limits."
```

**Ambiguity Resolution**
```
User: "Turn on the lights"
System: "Which lights? Interior lights, headlights, or dashboard lights?"
User: "Interior lights"
System: "Interior lights are now on."
```

## Response Generation

### Text-to-Speech System
**Piper TTS**
- Neural voice synthesis
- Low latency processing
- Natural automotive voice profile
- Customizable speaking rate

**Voice Characteristics**
- Clear articulation for road noise
- Confident, professional tone
- Gender-neutral or user-selectable
- Appropriate volume auto-adjustment

### Response Templates
**Status Confirmations**
```
"Temperature set to {value} degrees"
"Engine RPM is currently {rpm}"
"Boost pressure increased to {psi} PSI"
"All systems operating normally"
```

**Error Messages**
```
"Sorry, I couldn't understand that command"
"That function is not available while driving"
"Engine temperature is too high for that adjustment"
"Please try again with a different command"
```

**Safety Warnings**
```
"Warning: Engine temperature is approaching limit"
"Boost pressure has reached maximum safe level"
"Vehicle speed is too high for that operation"
"Emergency mode activated - all systems reset"
```

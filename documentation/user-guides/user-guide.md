# User Guide

## Getting Started

### First Time Setup

After installation, your Automotive LLM System needs a brief calibration period:

1. **Start your vehicle** and ensure all systems are operational
2. **Wait 30 seconds** for the system to initialize
3. **Listen for the startup confirmation**: "Automotive LLM System started - Listening for commands"
4. **Test basic wake word**: Say "Hey Car" and wait for acknowledgment

### Understanding the System States

The system operates in several states indicated by audio feedback:

- **üü¢ Listening**: Ready for wake word detection
- **üîµ Processing**: Wake word detected, listening for command
- **üü° Thinking**: Processing your command with AI
- **üü† Speaking**: Providing voice response
- **üî¥ Error**: System issue (requires attention)

## Advanced Features

### Conversation Context

The system remembers recent interactions for natural conversation:

```
User: "Turn on the AC"
System: "Air conditioning is now on"
User: "Make it cooler"
System: "Setting temperature to 70 degrees"
User: "That's perfect"
System: "Temperature locked at 70 degrees"
```

### Multi-Step Commands

Some commands require confirmation for safety:

```
User: "Increase boost pressure by 5 PSI"
System: "This will increase boost to 15 PSI total. This modification may affect your engine warranty and could cause damage if your engine is not properly tuned. Say 'confirm' to proceed."
User: "Confirm"
System: "Boost pressure increased to 15 PSI. Monitoring engine parameters."
```

### Conditional Commands

The system can execute commands based on conditions:

```
"If engine temperature goes above 200 degrees, turn on maximum fan"
"When I stop the car, turn off performance mode"
"If it's raining, turn on the defrost automatically"
```
